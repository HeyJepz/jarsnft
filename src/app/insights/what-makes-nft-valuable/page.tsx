        <h2 className="my-6 text-3xl font-bold">Overview</h2>
        <P>{`The rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has been huge, with its use cases going well beyond just the simple digital images (JPEGS) used for profile photographs. Perhaps the most striking feature of NFTs is their adaptability. They serve a wide range of interests and objectives. Some collectors appreciate NFTs for their functional applications, while others are drawn to their artistic appeal.  There's also a large group of collectors who see NFTs as a possible economic opportunity and hope to earn from trading them.`}</P>
        <P>{`Unlike other traded assets, NFTs have distinguishing characteristics such as immutability (unchangeability) and verified uniqueness from the blockchain.  NFT purchases might be driven by a variety of factors.  Some collectors may just like the excitement of the purchase itself.  Without a doubt, most collectors want to find NFTs that will retain their worth over time.  This raises the question of what makes an NFT worthwhile.`}</P>

        <h2 className="my-6 text-3xl font-bold">How do NFTs get its value?</h2>
        <P>{`NFTs have received a bad reputation due to one of this factor. 
        With many people having doubts in their mind about the the concept of owning a digital photo that can be stolen with a screenshot. 
        But there are various reasons on why NFTs have its values that goes beyond just being an owned digital image. These can include:`}</P>
        <h4 className="my-6 text-lg font-bold tracking-wider">
          1. Scarcity & Rarity
        </h4>
        <P>{`These are two sides of the same coin. 
        Scarce NFTs, such as limited edition releases, are more appealing because they express a sense of exclusivity. Rarity can also be derived from unique features within an NFT collection. 
        Consider CryptoPunks: while all 10,000 are technically NFTs, some punks with unique characteristics, such as laser eyes, command much higher prices.`}</P>
        <P>{`To explain further:`}</P>
        <ul className="-mt-2 ml-14 list-disc leading-loose tracking-wide dark:text-gray-300">
          <li className="mb-3">
            <span className="font-bold">Scarcity:</span>
            {` The number of NFTs available in a collection. Scarcity is created via limited edition releases or collections that contain a set quantity of NFTs. Consider a collection of 100 unique NFTs vs one of 10,000. Because of its scarcity, the one with 100 will most likely be worth more.`}
          </li>
          <li className="mb-6">
            <span className="font-bold">Rarity:</span>
            {`  Looks beyond just the quantity to identify distinctive features within a collection. The rarity of NFT-associated traits varies. CryptoPunks with uncommon features, such as laser eyes or ape fur, are far more expensive than typical ones. Collectors can use rarity analysis techniques to find these more um traits.`}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 className="my-6 text-lg font-bold tracking-wider">
          2. Authenticity
        </h4>
        <P>{`NFTs are created using blockchain technology, which generates a tamper-proof record of ownership. This assures collectors that their NFT is genuine and not a clone. Authenticity is especially critical for high-value NFTs and those that are linked to physical assets.`}</P>
        <P>{`Blockchain technology supports NFTs, allowing for a secure and transparent record of ownership. This ensures that collectors own the genuine NFT rather than a clone. Consider purchasing a rare painting - authenticity is critical to its worth. Similarly, authenticity is critical for pricey NFTs and those related to actual assets (for example, an NFT reflecting ownership of a real-world painting).`}</P>
        <h4 className="my-6 text-lg font-bold tracking-wider">
          3. Cultural Significance
        </h4>
        <P>{`NFTs that capitalize on trends, memes, or big cultural events might become valuable. For example, owning a legendary meme like Doge as an NFT can be valuable because of its cultural significance, just like owning a great photograph or piece of art. The meme itself, or its potential for future reference and usage, may be the source of value.`}</P>
        <h4 className="my-6 text-lg font-bold tracking-wider">4. Utility</h4>
        <P>{`Some NFTs provide additional benefits or usefulness beyond just simply owning a digital collection.  This could include access to special content, membership in a club, or even in-game goodies.  Utility provides value since it gives the NFT a purpose other than just looking good in a digital wallet.`}</P>
        <P>{`In other words, not all NFTs are exclusively digital collectibles though. Some provide additional benefits or functionalities, increasing value besides ownership. `}</P>
        <P>{`Let us explain further: `}</P>
        <ul className="-mt-2 ml-14 list-disc leading-loose tracking-wide dark:text-gray-300">
          <li className="mb-3">
            <span className="font-bold">Exclusive stuff:</span>
            {` Members-only stuff, such as behind-the-scenes footage or early access to a creator's upcoming releases.`}
          </li>
          <li className="mb-6">
            <span className="font-bold">Community Membership:</span>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <P>{`Utility for NFTs related to video games may include unique in-game objects or avatars that may be used within the game.`}</P>
        <h4 className="my-6 text-lg font-bold tracking-wider">
          5. Historical Significance
        </h4>
        <P>{` NFTs that were early milestones in the development of technology or created by well-known artists can be valuable due to their historical importance.  Owning one of the first NFTs minted, or an NFT by a well-known artist, is like owning a piece of online history. These NFTs are valued similarly to historical objects or works of art.`}</P>
        <h4 className="my-6 text-lg font-bold tracking-wider">
          6s. Strong Community
        </h4>
        <P>{`A strong, engaged community surrounding an NFT project can increase its value. A passionate community could create a sense of shared ownership and enthusiasm, boosting up demand for NFTs.   Consider popular projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club: the strong community surrounding the project adds value to having a Bored Ape NFT, and this community can create a network effect, making the project more valuable as more people join.`}</P>
